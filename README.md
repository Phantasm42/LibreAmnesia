# LibreAmnesia

The *LibreAmnesia* project aims to create a complete, free content first-person survival horror game, but *LibreAmnesia* by itself is just the raw material for a game. It must be paired with a compatible engine to be played.

There is a massive [back catalogue](https://www.moddb.com/games/amnesia-the-dark-descent), spanning over a decade, containing thousands of *Amnesia: The Dark Descent* levels and other modifications (“mods”) made by fans of the game. *LibreAmnesia* aims to be compatible with these and allows most to be played without the need to use non-free software.

# How to Play

Since *LibreAmnesia* is only the game data, you will still need to download an engine. Currently, there isn't a way to download precompiled engine and game binaries without the need to obtain non-free software, so the only way to get an engine is to compile one with *Amnesia: The Dark Descent* source code. The work in progress can then be played in Windows by placing all of its contents in an empty folder and copying Amnesia.exe along with its dll files, or on a GNU/Linux distribution by simply copying Amnesia.bin.x86 or Amnesia.bin.x86_64 and some required libraries.

# What “Free” Means

When we speak of free content or software, we refer to the movement in which your freedom to use, copy, modify, and study a work is not infringed. For example, you may freely use *LibreAmnesia* for any purpose you see fit, you may redistribute it to anyone without needing to ask for permission, you may modify it (provided you keep the license intact, see `LICENSE`), and you may study it. You may read more about free software at the [GNU](http://www.gnu.org/) and [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org) websites.

# Contributing to LibreAmnesia

Contributions to *LibreAmnesia* are always welcome, however, there are a few guidelines that should be followed:

## Intellectual property

We know people hate legalese, but this is important. This applies to **everything** which is submitted.

You must be careful when basing on existing graphics or sounds. Most *Amnesia: The Dark Descent* projects are lax on reusing intellectual property. There are many mods which contain modified *Amnesia: The Dark Descent* models, for example. However, due to the nature of this project, we do not have the same liberty to rip as we please.

The general rules go as follows:

  1. You must have permission for everything you submit. If you make your own resources, do not base them on resources from *Amnesia: The Dark Descent* or any other restricted work. If you take work from other places, please make sure that the work is freely-licensed or that you obtain permission to include it in the *LibreAmnesia* project. They may not place additional restrictions compared to the normal *LibreAmnesia* license.

  2. Do not try to emulate *Amnesia: The Dark Descent* resources exactly. Where possible, put effort to make new versions look visibly different from *Amnesia: The Dark Descent*. This is a tough call because our compatibility with *Amnesia: The Dark Descent* mods limits how far we can deviate, but it is feasible.
  
  3. Be especially careful of “free textures” (or “free sounds” or “free graphics”) sites. Although these would appear at first to be okay to use, many are free for “non-commercial use only.” One of the things we want to be able to do is put this in GNU/Linux distributions (which can be sold or developed commercially).

## Levels

Not all levels for *LibreAmnesia* will be made. However, *LibreAmnesia* is best played if mods that were originally made for *Amnesia: The Dark Descent* are compatible with it (please report if mods work on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Phantasm42/LibreAmnesia/issues)).

## Submitting your work

The most common, and a fairly simple method, to submit your work is by posting it on the [LibreAmnesia Discord](https://discord.gg/7t2qr7R3mp).

This allows a quick cycle of development and feedback.

An alternative to using the *LibreAmnesia* Discord server is to post your submission on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Phantasm42/LibreAmnesia/issues), which may also be peer-reviewed and provide a feedback cycle.

Unfortunately, the *LibreAmnesia* project cannot provide hosting space in the form of a webpage nor FTP, however, there are many free file hosts to use when you need a location to upload files. Sites and services such as [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) and [Mega](https://mega.co.nz/), as well as others, are common and should be simple to use.

### Crediting information

*LibreAmnesia* is made up of submissions from many people all over the globe. All of them, including **you**, deserve credit!

### Using Git

You can also commit on a clone of the *LibreAmnesia* repository, although this is a technical task and it is okay to let other *LibreAmnesia* maintainers to do it instead: that is our normal mode of operation. However, pull requests are much appreciated and you may submit them in any manner you wish, with GitHub’s direct pull requests being the simplest, but by far not the only means.
